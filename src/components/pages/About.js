                    I have been programming for about as long as I can remember! From silly little .NET C# applications in youth (when the framework was new!), using buttons to change text in labels, all the way to taking courses in college and dabbling in new languages and platforms. Most recently, I dove into a web development bootcamp to consolidate, modernize, and most importantly improve my knowledge and practices.

                    My aspiration is to leverage this lifelong familiarity with technical thinking and affinity for soaking up new information and skills to make an impact in the world of development. I live for the systematic breaking down - and creative solving - of problems. I would definitely update this section to be fuller and less awkwardly worded before it were to ever see the professional world. :)
