## Description

A ReactJS single page application that provides a navigatable view of my profile and experience as a developer. There is as yet no back end through which to provide data - it is all stored and accessed within the build.

## Usage

Navigate through the views using the links at the top of the page. 'About' displays a picture and brief bio. 'Portfolio' displays image cards embedded with links to deployed links and/or repositories of past projects. 'Contact' provides a form that can be used to send a message. 'Resume' provides a quick run-down of proficiencies as well as a download of a full resume. Always present the bottom of the application are external links to GitHub, LinkedIn, and Stack Overflow profiles.
